EXPLANATION: Inner Join table was chosen because matching values in the joined column connects the 4 tables A. Customer, B. Address, C. City and D. Country which are either foreign key or primary key. We are trying to extract data from 4 separate tables to find the number of
customers of the top 10 countries with the most customers. 
First, we need to select the count of customer_id and also select the country. Then we need to Join the four tables with the common columns. The customer table has address_id column in common with address table.

Query
SELECT D.country,
COUNT(customer_id) AS number_customers FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id GROUP BY country
ORDER BY number_customers DESC LIMIT 10

We are trying to extract data from 4 separate tables to find the number of customers of the top 10 countries having the Cities in those countries with the most customers. First, we need to select the count of 
customer_id, country, and city. Then we need to Join the four tables with the common columns. The customer table has address_id column in common with address table. 
The address table has column city_id in common with city table. The city table has column country_id in common with Country table. Finally we need to group by country and add a condition to sort each country
having the city with the most customers and order them with largest amount of customers to least and limit to 10.

Query 
SELECT D.country,
C.city,
COUNT(customer_id) AS number_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil',
'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY country,
city
ORDER BY number_customers DESC LIMIT 10

Inner Join table was chosen because matching values in the joined column connects the 5 tables A. Customer, B. Address, C. City, D. Country and E.payment which are either foreign key or primary key.
We are trying to extract data from 5 separate tables to find the top 5 paying customers located in the top 5 cities.
First, we need to select the colums customer_id, country, first_name, last_name, city and total amount paid. Then we need to Join the 5 tables with the common columns. 
The customer table has address_id column in common with address table. The address table has column city_id in common with city table. The city table has column country_id in common with Country table. 
And the customer table has customer_id column in common with the payment table. Next step we need to condition the columns where the top
10 cities have top customer paying. Finally we need to group by customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country and Order by total_amount_paid and limit 5.

Query
SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
C.city,
D.country,
Sum(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
From customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora', 'So Leopoldo', 'Tianjin', 'Shanwei', 'Citrus Heights', 'Teboksary', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Cianjur', 'Acua')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
C.city,
D.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC LIMIT 5
